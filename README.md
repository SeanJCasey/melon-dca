# Dollar Cost Averaging Challenge (Avantgarde)

##Problem description

The basic challenge is to create an ExchangeAdapter which gives fund managers the option to use DCA.

In implementing DCA you are free to use VulcanSwap, or some simplified version of it with fewer features, or even a solution that does not use VulcanSwap at all.
